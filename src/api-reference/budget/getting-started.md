### Explore the API

#### Prerequisites

1. [Create a sandbox](https://developer.concur.com/manage-apps/register.html) if you don't already have one.
2. Read the [Getting Started](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html) section of [Authentication API](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html).

Once you have registered your application, read about the [Budget Category](budget-category.html), [Fiscal Year](fiscal-year.html), [Budget Tracking Field](./cost-object.html), and [Budget Item Header](./budget-header.html) endpoints.

#### Retrieve a User Access Token:

Before making requests to the Budget API, you must [obtain an access token from the Authentication API](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html).

The response will include an `access_token` field, which contains your access token. For subsequent calls, you will need to include this access token in the `Authorization` header of your calls. An `id_token` will be also included in the response. In order to retrieve the unique ID for your user, you will have to decode this `id_token` at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). You will need this ID in order to access the Budget endpoints.

Examples:

cURL:

```shell
curl -d "client_secret={YOUR SECRET}&client_id={YOUR CLIENT ID}&grant_type=password&username={YOUR USERNAME}&password={YOUR PASSWORD}" https://us.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0/token
```

HTTPie:

```shell
